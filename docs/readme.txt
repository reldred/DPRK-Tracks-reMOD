North Korean Track Set. This set adds various tracktypes optimised
for use with the North Korean Train Set.

North Korean Track Set 1.9
MD5Hash:  {{GRF_MD5}}
Version:  13
GRF ID:   "EN\30\01"

---------------------
2 General information
---------------------

2.1 Requirements
----------------
- OpenTTD 1.2.0-RC1 or nightly r23971, or higher
- Not compatible with TTDPatch


2.2 Installation
----------------
OpenTTD:
	see http://wiki.openttd.org/NewGRF
	Releases will be available from the ingame Online Content Downloader.
	
2.3 Parameter settings
----------------------
Company colours
	When turned on, the depots will no longer have the real colours, but
	instead use company colours. When turned off the depots will have the
	real colours.
	
Cost parameters
	With the cost parameters you can set purchase and maintenance costs. You
	can set the costs to the following values:
	1/4x, 1/2x, 1, 2x, 4x

Custom signals
	Use signals designed to resemble the signals used in North Korea. If you
	use other NewGRFs like the industrial trackset, it should not be set to
	"only for DPRK tracks," as this would give those tracks default signals.

Availability parameters
	The DPRK trackset adds a large amount of tracks, and you might not be
	using all of them. For this reason you might want to turn off some
	tracktypes.
	If you want you can even set all tracks to be available from the start.
	
Maximum speeds
	North Korean tracks are kinda shit, ngl. Only one line is known to allow
	speeds of up to 100km/h. That makes trains way too slow though, so by
	default tracks are set to much higher maximum speed. It can be turned
	down for extra realism.
  
Urban tunnel portals
	Urban tracks can have "urban" tunnel portals. These will take up an
	entire tile, like the ground underneath the urban tracks.
	
Depot sprites
	By default this NewGRF adds custom depots. You might want to use depots
	provided by different NewGRFs. For this reason you can turn off
	custom depots.
	
Bridge track style
	For the most true to life results, Auz Bridges without ballast need to
	be used. To make the bridges look good, you might need ballast anyway.
	
Enable fences
	I don't like them; you might.
  
2.4 Usage
---------
Starting date
    The tracks become available as soon as there are compatible trains.

What tracks do I use?
	In almost all cases, the Standard Gauge "Trunk" Variant will be
	what you want. The "Branch" variant is cheaper, but also slower.
	The "Modern" variant is almost always unneccessary, as those kinds
	of speeds aren't required for most trains.
	For metro vehicle and narrow gauge vehicles you need 3rd rail and
	narrow gauge tracks respectively.
	
Why would I use narrow gauge?
	Narrow gauge, while weaker and slower, is significantly cheaper in
	all possible ways. IRL it is mostly used on less important lines,
	mostly through mountainous terrain.

4 Background information
------------------------

This NewGRF was developed out of an offhand remark on the OpenTTD Discord
channel. I eventually tried making the set a reality, as it proved an
interesting challenge as I would have to develop a variety of trains.
Before making this set I was only experienced in making multiple unit-type
trains.

I am in no way affiliated with the DPRK. I do not condone the actions of
their leader, I do not subscribe to Juche, or any other DPRK-based ideology.
I do not have any negative emotions towards the innocent citizens of the
DPRK. This NewGRF has been developed with the intend to entertain and
it is in no way my intention to offend anyone.

5 Frequently Asked Questions
----------------------------

Help! I'm not seeing X track.
	If a track is not on the list with tracktypes, this is likely because
	you do not have a newgrf that includes trains for this specific railtype
	loaded.
